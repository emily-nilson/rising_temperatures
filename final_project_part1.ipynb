    "As global temperature continues to increase as a result of human-induced climate change, more and more people will be at risk of heat-related illness--or worse, death. It is important to understand how temperatures are expected to change and how many people could potentially be at risk so adequate measures can be taken to: raise awareness of the dangers of high temperatures, ensure electric grid reliability to power air conditioners, ensure ample capacity for hospitals and medical facilities to treat patients, etc. "
